Tikal’s Code Challenge 

You can use whatever IDE you choose, or use Plunker to implement. Don’t forget to hit save. When you are done, email the plunk url (with the hash) or the entire project code base with clear instructions on how to execute it. 

* Plunker comes with many boilerplates, you can use them if you like (use the green ‘new’ dropdown) or create your own.
 * Please choose a boilerplate (framework) you feel most comfortable with (Angular 1, Angular 4, React, Vue.js, etc) and use it - This is not optional! You can choose whatever 3rd party library you deem necessary.

* Try to implement with architecture considerations and edge cases in mind.

Recommendation: read everything before you start to implement.

Good morning, agent. MI6 is trying to gather statistics about its missions. Your mission, should you decide to accept it, has two parts.

Sample input: 
[
   {agent: '007', country: 'Brazil', 
        address: 'Avenida Vieira Souto 168 Ipanema, Rio de Janeiro',
        date: 'Dec 17, 1995, 9:45:17 PM'
   },
   {agent: '005', country: 'Poland', 
        address: 'Rynek Glowny 12, Krakow',
        date: 'Apr 5, 2011, 5:05:12 PM'
   },
   {agent: '007', country: 'Morocco', 
        address: '27 Derb Lferrane, Marrakech',
        date: 'Jan 1, 2001, 12:00:00 AM'
   },
   {agent: '005', country: 'Brazil', 
        address: 'Rua Roberto Simonsen 122, Sao Paulo',
        date: 'May 5, 1986, 8:40:23 AM'
   },
   {agent: '011', country: 'Poland', 
        address: 'swietego Tomasza 35, Krakow',
        date: 'Sep 7, 1997, 7:12:53 PM'
   },
   {agent: '003', country: 'Morocco', 
        address: 'Rue Al-Aidi Ali Al-Maaroufi, Casablanca',
        date: 'Aug 29, 2012, 10:17:05 AM'
   },
   {agent: '008', country: 'Brazil', 
        address: 'Rua tamoana 418, tefe',
        date: 'Nov 10, 2005, 1:25:13 PM'
   },
   {agent: '013', country: 'Poland', 
        address: 'Zlota 9, Lublin',
        date: 'Oct 17, 2002, 10:52:19 AM'
   },
   {agent: '002', country: 'Morocco', 
        address: 'Riad Sultan 19, Tangier',
        date: 'Jan 1, 2017, 5:00:00 PM'
   },
   {agent: '009', country: 'Morocco', 
        address: 'atlas marina beach, agadir',
        date: 'Dec 1, 2016, 9:21:21 PM'
   }

Part 1:  An isolated agent is defined as an agent that participated in a single mission.
 Implement an algorithm that finds the most isolated country (the country with the highest degree of isolation).
 For the above input:
	•	Brazil has 1 isolated agent (008) and 2 non-isolated agents (007, 005)
	•	Poland has 2 isolated agents (011, 013) and one non-isolated agent (005)
	•	Morocco has 3 isolated agents (002, 009, 003) and one non-isolated agent (007)
 So the result is Morocco with an isolation degree of 3.

Part 2:
	•	Without using any css frameworks or component libraries, implement the grid below with the following guidelines:
	◦	Get as close as you can to the styling below
	◦	Sorted by mission date ascending

Bonus (if you have time):
	•	Find the closest and farthest missions from 10 Downing st. London 
	(you can use Google API for this), then mark them on the table:
	◦	The closest mission in green
	◦	The farthest mission in red
